            About Natural Stones
        </h4>
        <p>
            Natural stones have a positive impact on various aspects of your life, such as your health, mood, and the energy of your home.

        <h4>
            The energies of natural stones
        </h4>
            <p>
                When you buy any natural stone, the first thing you should do is to cleanse it, in other words, neutralize it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your stones carry and trap the energies of the environment they are in and the people who touch them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, when someone else touches your stones, it is best to cleanse them to make use of their energy in the most effective way.
